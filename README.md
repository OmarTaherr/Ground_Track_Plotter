# Ground_Track_Plotter
This MATLAB script generates the ground track of a satellite orbit on a planisphere and a 3D orbit visualization. It takes either classical orbital elements or position and velocity vectors as input to calculate and plot the ground track. The script considers Earth's J2 effect and allows for both animated and static ground track visualization.
